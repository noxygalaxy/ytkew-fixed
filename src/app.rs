//! Application state and the pieces that drive it.
//!
//! [`App`] is the single owner of everything the interface reads. Work that
//! touches the network runs in spawned tasks and reports back through
//! [`AppMsg`], so the UI thread never blocks on the API.
//!
//! The parts live in focused submodules: [`input`] maps keys and mouse events
//! onto actions, [`library`] holds the lazily-loaded tree, [`menu`] the
//! overlay and its settings, [`graphics`] the album-art protocols, [`media`]
//! the D-Bus surface and [`search`] everything that reaches the API.
