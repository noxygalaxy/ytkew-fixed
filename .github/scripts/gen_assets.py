"""Regenerate every derived asset from its single source.

Three jobs:

* The wordmark. The terminal draws it with block and box-drawing characters,
  which only line up if the renderer's font tiles them exactly -- browsers do
  not guarantee that, and the letterforms come apart. Emitting the same grid
  as vector shapes gives identical output everywhere.
* The icon. `assets/ytkew.svg` is the only copy anyone should edit; the
  website needs its own under `src/` for Astro's pipeline and another in
  `public/` for the favicon. Copying them here means changing the logo is one
  file, not three that quietly drift.
* The screenshots. `assets/ytkew_*.png` are what the README and the guide
  pages show; the site needs its own copies under `public/`. Same reason as
  the icon: one file to replace when a screenshot is retaken.

Run it after touching the icon, a screenshot, or `src/ui/banner.rs`:

    python3 .github/scripts/gen_assets.py

CI runs it too and fails if the tree changes, so a stale copy cannot ship.
